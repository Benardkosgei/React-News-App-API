 # COMP2112 Assignment 2 - Custom React Web Application

This repository contains a custom React web application developed for COMP2112 Assignment 2. The application utilizes `react-router-dom` for navigation, state and effect hooks for data management, and features a shared Bootstrap navigation bar for a consistent user interface.

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. React Application Setup

- The project is created using the `create-react-app` npm package.
- `react-router-dom` is employed to create a multi-page application with a minimum of 4 page components.

### 2. Stateful Component and Data Management

- A stateful component manages the application's data using the `useState` hook.
- Data manipulation within the stateful component is implemented, including adding, editing, or deleting items.
- Display of data from the state is incorporated across various components in the application.
- At least one user interaction demonstrating state changes is implemented.

### 3. Styling

- The application is styled using Bootstrap for a professional and responsive design.
- Bootstrap components, such as forms, buttons, and icons, are utilized, and a customized Bootstrap navigation bar is implemented.

### 4. Page Components and Navigation

- At least 4 separate page components (e.g., homepage, settings) are created using `react-router-dom`.
- Navigation links in the shared Bootstrap navigation bar facilitate seamless switching between these pages.

### 5. useEffect and API Integration

- `useEffect` is implemented to fetch data from a mock API or a real API.
- The fetched data is displayed meaningfully within the application.

### 6. GitHub Commits and README.md

- Regular commits (minimum 4 spread over at least 2 days) are made to the GitHub repository.
- The README.md file explains the purpose of the application and includes a link to the live website.
- The correct GitHub repository link is included in the Blackboard submission.

### 7. Deployment

- The application is published to Render.com or another public web server.
- The live website link is included in both the README.md file and the Blackboard submission.
